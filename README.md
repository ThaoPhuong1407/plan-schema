# plan-schema

Schema validation and coercion utilities for TPNs and HTNs

As this is a pre-release version **plan-schema** has not been
published to [Clojars](https://clojars.org/). You can still clone it and install
it locally.

Check out the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Documentation

The **plan-schema** library is part of the [PAMELA](https://github.com/dollabs/pamela) suite of tools.

*TBD* API docs

## Building

The **plan-schema** library uses [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) as a build tool. For
more on boot see [Sean's blog](http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/02/02/boot-new/) and the [boot Wiki](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki).

Install **boot** if you haven't done so already.

You can install **plan-schema** locally with `boot build`.

You can get help for all available boot tasks with `boot -h`.

## Usage

For convenience you may add the [plan-schema/bin](bin) directory to your `PATH`
(or simply refer to the startup script as `./bin/plan-schema`).
